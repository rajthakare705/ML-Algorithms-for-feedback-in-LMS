# ML-Algorithms-for-feedback-in-LMS 

## Introduction
This study describes a learning management system (LMS) designed to enhance theoretical assessments and provide students with detailed, descriptive feedback. The LMS is comprised oftwo interconnected systems serving distinct functions.The first system concentrates on assigning grades to student work, while the second provides detailed, descriptive feedback. The undertaking involves the integration of two machine-learning models into the LMS website. By automating the evaluation of explanatory the motive is to give appropriate feedback to the students thought whichthey can reflect upon their errors and learn from them. By automating the evaluation of explanatory responses and providing immediate feedback, the project seeks to improve the efficacy of educational assessment procedures.
