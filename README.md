# ML-Algorithms-for-feedback-in-LMS 

## Introduction
This study describes a learning management system (LMS) designed to enhance theoretical assessments and provide students with detailed, descriptive feedback. The LMS is comprised oftwo interconnected systems serving distinct functions.The first system concentrates on assigning grades to student work, while the second provides detailed, descriptive feedback. The undertaking involves the integration of two machine-learning models into the LMS website. By automating the evaluation of explanatory the motive is to give appropriate feedback to the students thought whichthey can reflect upon their errors and learn from them. By automating the evaluation of explanatory responses and providing immediate feedback, the project seeks to improve the efficacy of educational assessment procedures.

## Conclusion
The Covid pandemic has changed the way of living of people in many different ways. The most affected was education field. Teachers(or instructors) and student were not able to figure out proper grading and feedback system. The Learning Management System(LMS) tool was not enough for catering the need. Sometimes feedback is also provided but the correct and required feedback is not available to students. The identification of correct form of feedback is done.The correct feedback format should be descriptive type having details about the mistakes, grammatical and spelling mistakes and suggestive improvements. this kind of feedback provides scope of improvement to students. The LMS should be integrated with models which can handle these two important tasks
and automate the system. The machine learning models should be integrated along with LMS interface. Through this study various factors, research paper,mathematical models, tools and techniques and algorithms were recognized which will be helping in generating the correct result. This report will be helping us in implementing the project correctly and completely.
